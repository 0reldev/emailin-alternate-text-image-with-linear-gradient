# Emailing: advertisement newsletter

## Responsive template example
Responsive template for advertising newsletters with alternate even two-column blocks and a linear-gradient colored background.

The challenge is to design a newsletter which can be displayed for every mail client and on every supports. 

Based on a template given on [Cerberus](https://tedgoas.github.io/Cerberus/) website, I worked on this specific version ordered by a client during my internship in a web agency.

This HTML file has been has been successfully tested on [testi.at](https://testi.at/) website with the following webclients:

Mobile:
- iPhone XS - Gmail
- iPhone 11 iOS 13
- iPhone 7 iOS 11
- Android 8 - Gmail
- Android 7 - Gmail

Webmail:
- Gmail - Chrome
- GSuite - Chrome



/!\ The linear gradient doesn't work for the following webclients below, but the structure works:

Desktop Client:
- Outlook 2019
- Office 365 (Win 10)
- Outlook 2010

Webmail:
- Yahoo - Chrome
- Outlook - Chrome
